# What is it?
This is a small joke program for the Windows operating system that, except for constantly displaying a "*Strange error*", does nothing more. This program does not have the purpose to cause harm
<blockquote> moreover, this application can be closed through the task manager or with the "TASKLIST" and "TASKKILL -force" commands! </blockquote>
And also this program is my first experience in writing code in the FASM assembler
